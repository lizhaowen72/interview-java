#### 1.傻屌面试题-什么是Spring IOC容器?
> Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of
Control (IoC) principle. IoC is also known as dependency
injection (DI). It is a process whereby objects define their
dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only

method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it
is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container
then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean.
